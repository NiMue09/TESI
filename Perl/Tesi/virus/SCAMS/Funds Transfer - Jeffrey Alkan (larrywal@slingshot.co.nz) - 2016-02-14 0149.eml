Good morning
Bearing in mind the nature of the content of this email coming from a 
person without referral, i apologize for any inconvenience. The urgency 
of this matter is why I had to contact you this way. My name is Jeffrey 
Alkan, a lawyer from Syria, now based in Istanbul Turkey due to the 
crisis back home in Syria. I have a proposal of mutual benefit for which 
you might be interested. We can share the proceeds 40% for you and 60% 
for me. It involves money transfer. I only hope you do not consider this 
some kind of joke or hoarse.
Regards
Alkan
